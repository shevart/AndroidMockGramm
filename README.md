# AndroidMockGramm
In this project I explore work with Android Camera API and Bitmap color filters.

## Road map for this project:
- Create UI for main screen
- *Work with test Camera API screen: display image from camera on the screen...DONE*
- Work with test Camera API screen: replace beetwen front and main camera
- Work with test Camera API screen: shoot and get image from camera as Bitmap
- Work with Camera screen: refactor and replace code from test screen; remove test code
- Work with test image selecting: pick picture from gallery
- Work with image selecting: refactor and replace code from test screen; remove test code
- Work with test image editing: research and experiments
- Work with image editing: work with UI
- Work with image editing: refactor and replace code from test screen; remove test code

## Additional features:
- Start app main screen theme with background
- Save edited picture on device
- Share edited picture
- Work with image editing: revert button (like Cmd+z)
